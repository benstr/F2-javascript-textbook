### Start a discussion on canvas.
Hopfully everyone is in canvas now. Be on the lookout to help out people there if you think you can help! Helping each other is the most effective way to figure out some problems!

### Google it.
Seriously though. Before asking questions at least do a google search about the error you are getting.

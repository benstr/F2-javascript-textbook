# Create your folder in the course github repository

- Fork the github repo: https://github.com/codefellows/sea-c11-javascript
- Add a subfolder to the "students" that is your name.
  - ie "students/hankyates" for me
- Add a README.md under your folder containing a little bit about yourself!
- Open a Pull Request between your fork and the Codefellows repository.
